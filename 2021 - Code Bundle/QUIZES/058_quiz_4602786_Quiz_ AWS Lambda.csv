You are going to be working with objects arriving in S3. Once they arrive you want to use AWS Lambda as a part of an AWS Data Pipeline to process and transform the data. How can you easily configure Lambda to know the data has arrived in a bucket?,multiple-choice,Run a cron job to check for new objects arriving in S3,Configure S3 bucket notifications to lambda,Configure S3 versioning to include writing logs to Lambda,Use Cloudwatch logs and have Cloudwatch events trigger Lambda.,2,Lambda functions are generally invoked by some sort of trigger. S3 has the ability to trigger a Lambda function whenever a new object appears in a bucket.
You are going to analyze the data coming in an Amazon Kinesis stream. You are going to use Lambda to process these records. What is a prerequisite when it comes to defining Lambda to access Kinesis stream records ?,multiple-choice,The Kinesis stream should be in the same account,The stream should not be older than 3 hours,The Kinesis stream should have its policy document to allow for AWS Lambda,None of these,1,"Lambda must be in the same account as the service triggering it, in addition to having an IAM policy granting it access."
"How can you make sure your Lambda functions have access to the other resources you are using in your big data architecture like S3, Redshift, etc.?",multiple-choice,Using a lifecycle policy for lambda,Using proper IAM users,Using proper IAM roles,Using Cognito pools.,3,IAM roles define the access a Lambda function has to the services it communicates with.
You are creating a Lambda - Kinesis stream environment in which Lambda is to check for the records in the stream and do some processing in its Lambda function. How does Lambda know there has been changes / updates to the Kinesis stream ?,multiple-choice,Kinesis streams has options to configure cron jobs to invoke Lambda,Cloudwatch logs notify Lambda,Kinesis streams notify lambda,Lambda polls Kinesis streams,4,"Although you think of a trigger as ""pushing"" events, Lambda actually polls your Kinesis streams for new activity."
"When using an Amazon Redshift database loader, how does Lambda keep track of files arriving in S3 to be processed and sent to Redshift ?",multiple-choice,In a DynamoDB table,In Lambda memory,In Lambda parameters,In Redshift cluster memory,1,
